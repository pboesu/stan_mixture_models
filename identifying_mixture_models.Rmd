Mixture modeling is a powerful technique for integrating multiple data
generating processes into a single model.  Unfortunately when those data
data generating processes are degenerate the resulting mixture model suffers
from inherent combinatorial non-identifiabilities that frustrate accurate
computation.  Consequently, in order to utilize mixture models reliably in
practice we need strong and principled prior information to ameliorate these
frustrations.

In this case study I will first introduce how mixture models are implemented
in Bayesian inference.  I will then discuss the non-identifiability inherent to
that construction as well as how the non-identifiability can be tempered with
principled prior information.  Lastly I will demonstrate how these issues
manifest in a simple example, with a final tangent to consider an additional
pathology that can arise in Bayesian mixture models.

# Mixture Models

In a mixture model we assume that a given measurement, $y$, can be drawn from
one of $K$ data generating processes, each with their own set of parameters,
$\pi_{k} ( y \mid \alpha_{k} )$.  To implement such a model we need to construct
the corresponding likelihood and then subsequent posterior distribution.

## The Mixture Likelihood

Let $z \in \{0 ,\ldots, K\}$ be an _assignment_ that indicates to which data
generating process our measurement was generated.  Conditioned on this
assignment, the mixture likelihood is just
$$
\pi (y \mid \boldsymbol{\alpha}, z)
=
\pi_{z} ( y \mid \alpha_{z} ),
$$
where $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_K)$.

By combining assignments with a set of data generating processes we admit an
extremely expressive class of models that encompass many different inferential
and decision problems.  For example, if multiple measurements $y_n$ are given
but the corresponding assignments $z_n$ are unknown then inference over the
mixture model is equivalent to _clustering_ the measurements across the
component data generating processes.  Similarly, if both the measurements and
the assignments are given then inference over the mixture model admits
_classification_ of future measurements.  Finally, _semi-supervised_ learning
corresponds to inference over a mixture model where only some of the assignments
are known.

In practice discrete assignments are difficult to fit accurately and
efficiently, but we can facilitate inference by _marginalizing_ the assignments
out of the model entirely.  If each component in the mixture occurs with
probability $\theta_k$,
$$
\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_K), \,
0 \le \theta_{k} \le 1, \,
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \theta_{k} = 1,
$$
then the assignments follow a multinomial distribution,
$$
\pi (z \mid \boldsymbol{\theta} )
=
\theta_{z},
$$
and the joint likelihood over the measurement and its assignment is given by
$$
\pi (y, z \mid \boldsymbol{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{\theta})
=
\pi (y \mid \boldsymbol{\alpha}, z) \,
\pi (z \mid \boldsymbol{\theta} )
=
\pi_{z} ( y \mid \alpha_{z} ) \, \theta_z.
$$
Marginalizing over all of the possible assignments then gives
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi (y \mid \boldsymbol{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{\theta})
&=
\sum_{z} \pi (y, z \mid \boldsymbol{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{\theta})
\\
&=
\sum_{z} \pi_{z} ( y \mid \alpha_{z} ) \, \theta_z
\\
&=
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \pi_{k} ( y \mid \alpha_{k} ) \, \theta_k
\\
&=
\sum_{k = 1}^{K}  \theta_k \, \pi_{k} ( y \mid \alpha_{k} ).
\end{align*}
$$
In words, after marginalizing out the assignments the mixture likelihood reduces
to a convex combination of the component data generating processes.

Marginalizing out the discrete assignments yields a likelihood that depends
on only continuous parameters, making it amenable to state-of-the-art tools like
Stan.  Moreover, modeling the latent mixture probabilities instead of the
discrete assignments admits more precise inferences as a consequence of the
Rao-Blackwell theorem.  From any perspective the marginalized mixture likelihood
is the ideal basis for inference.

## Bayesian Mixture Posteriors

In order to perform Bayesian inference over a mixture model we need to
complement the mixture likelihood with prior distributions for both the
component parameters, $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$, and the mixture probabilities,
$\boldsymbol{\theta}$.  Assuming that these distributions are independent a
priori,
$$
\pi(\boldsymbol{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{\theta})
=
\pi(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \, \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta}),
$$
the subsequent posterior for a single measurement takes the form
$$
\pi(\boldsymbol{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{\theta} \mid y)
\propto
\pi(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \, \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta})
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \theta_k \, \pi_{k} ( y \mid \alpha_k ).
$$

Similarly, the posterior for multiple measurements becomes
$$
\pi(\boldsymbol{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{\theta} \mid \mathbf{y})
\propto
\pi(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \, \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta})
\sum_{n = 1}^{N}
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \theta_k \, \pi_{k} ( y_n \mid \alpha_k ).
$$
Additional measurements, however, do not impact the non-identifiability inherent
to mixture models.  Consequently we will consider only a single measurement
in the proceeding section, returning to multiple measurements in the example.

# Degenerate Mixture Models and Non-identifiability

When making inferences with a mixture model we need to learn each of the
component weights, $\theta_k$, and the component parameters, $\alpha_k$.
This introduces a subtle challenge because if the measurement cannot
discriminate between the components then it cannot discriminate between the
component parameters.

If the individual component distributions $\pi_{k} (y \mid \alpha_{k})$ are
distinct then the unique characteristics of each can be enough to inform the
corresponding parameters individually and the mixture model is straightforward
to fit.  Circumstances become much more dire, however, in the _degenerate_ case
when the components are identical,
$\pi_{k} (y \mid \alpha_{k}) = \pi (y \mid \alpha_{k})$.  In this case there is
a fundamental ambiguity as to which parameters $\alpha_{k}$ are associated with
each component in the mixture.

To see this, let $\sigma$ denote a permutation of the indices in our mixture,
$$
\sigma (1, \ldots, K) \mapsto ( \sigma(1), \ldots, \sigma(K)),
$$
with
$$
\sigma (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) = \sigma( \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_K)
\mapsto ( \alpha_{\sigma(1)}, \ldots, \alpha_{\sigma(K)}).
$$
When the component distributions are identical the mixture likelihood is
invariant to any permutation of the indices,
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi(y \mid \sigma(\boldsymbol{\alpha}), \sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta}))
&=
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \theta_{\sigma(k)} \,
\pi_{\sigma(k)} ( y \mid \alpha_{\sigma(k)} )
\\
&=
\sum_{k' = 1}^{K} \theta_{k'} \,
\pi_{k'} ( y \mid \alpha_{k'} )
\\
&=
\pi(y \mid \boldsymbol{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{\theta}).
\end{align*}
$$

Moreover, when the priors are _exchangeable_,
$\pi (\sigma(\boldsymbol{\alpha})) = \pi(\boldsymbol{\alpha})$
and $\pi (\sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta})) = \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta})$,
then the posterior will inherit the permutation invariance of the mixture
likelihood,
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi(\sigma(\boldsymbol{\alpha}), \sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \mid y)
&\propto
\pi(\sigma(\boldsymbol{\alpha})) \, \pi(\sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta}))
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \theta_{\sigma(k)} \,
\pi_{\sigma(k)} ( y \mid \alpha_{\sigma(k)} )
\\
&\propto
\pi(\sigma(\boldsymbol{\alpha})) \, \pi(\sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta}))
\sum_{k' = 1}^{K} \theta_{k'} \,
\pi_{k'} ( y \mid \alpha_{k'} )
\\
&\propto
\pi(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \, \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta})
\sum_{k' = 1}^{K} \theta_{k'} \,
\pi_{k'} ( y \mid \alpha_{k'} )
\\
&=
\pi(\boldsymbol{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{\theta} \mid y).
\end{align*}
$$
In this case all of our inferences will be the same regardless of how we
label the mixture components with explicit indices.

Because of this labeling degeneracy the posterior distribution will be
non-identified.  In particular, it will manifest multimodality, with one mode
for each of the possible labelings.  For a mixture with $K$ identical components
there are $K!$ possible labelings and hence any degenerate mixture model will
exhibit at least $K!$ modes.

Hence even for a relatively small number of components the posterior
distribution will have too many modes for any statistical algorithm to
accurately quantify unless the modes collapse into each other.  For example, if
we applied Markov chain Monte Carlo then any chain would be able to explore one
of the modes but it would not be able to transition _between_ the modes, at
least not within in any finite running time.

# Identifying Degenerate Bayesian Mixture Models

Even if we had a statistical algorithm that could transition between the
degenerate modes and explore the entire mixture posterior, typically there will
be too many modes to complete that exploration in any reasonable time.
Consequently if we want to accurately fit these models in practice then we
need to break the labeling degeneracy and remove the extreme multimodality
altogether.  

Exactly how we break the labeling degeneracy depends on what prior information
we can exploit.  In particular, our strategy will be different depending on
whether our prior information is exchangeable or not.

## Identification with Non-exchangeable Prior Information

Because the posterior distribution inherits the permutation-invariance of the
mixture likelihood only if the priors are exchangeable, one way to
immediately obstruct the labeling degeneracy of the mixture posterior is to
employ non-exchangeable priors.  This approach is especially useful when each
component of the likelihood is meant to be responsible for a specific purpose,
for example when each component models a known subpopulations with distinct
behaviors about which we have prior information.  If this principled prior
information is strong enough then the prior can suppress all but the
one labeling consistent with these responsibilities, ensuring a unimodal
mixture posterior distribution.

## Identification with Exchangeable Prior Information

When our prior information is exchangeable there is nothing preventing the
mixture posterior from becoming multimodal and impractical to fit.  When our
inferences are also exchangeable, however, we can exploit the symmetry of the
labeling degeneracies to simplify the computational problem dramatically.

In this section we'll study the symmetric geometry induced by labeling
degeneracies and show how that symmetry can be used to reduce the multimodal
mixture posterior into a unimodal distribution that yields exactly the same
inferences while being far easier to fit.

### The Geometry of a Degenerate Posterior

Each labeling is characterized by the unique assignment of indices to the
components in our mixture.  Permuting the indices yields a new assignment
and hence a new labeling of our mixture model.  Consequently a natural way to
identify each labeling is to a choose a standard set of indices,
$\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_K$, and distinguish each labeling by the permutation
that maps to the appropriate indices,
$\alpha_{\sigma(1)}, \ldots, \alpha_{\sigma(K)}$.  The standard indices
themselves identify a labeling with the trivial permutation that leaves the
indices unchanged.

In general it is difficult to utilize these permutations, but if the component
parameters, $\alpha_n$, are scalar then we can exploit their unique
_ordering_ to readily identify permutations and hence labelings.  For example,
if we choose the standard labeling to be the one where the parameter values
are ordered, $\alpha_1 \le  \ldots \le \alpha_K$, then any permutation will
yield a new ordering of the parameters,
$\alpha_{\sigma(1)} \le \ldots \le \alpha_{\sigma(K)}$, which then identifies
another labeling.  In other words, we can identify the each labeling by the
ordering the parameter values.

This identification also has a welcome geometric interpretation.  The region of
parameter space satisfying a given ordering constraint, such as
$\alpha_1 \le  \ldots \le \alpha_K$, defines a square pyramid with the apex
point at zero.  The $K$-dimensional parameter space neatly decomposes into $K!$
of these pyramids, each with a distinct ordering and hence association with a
unique labeling.  

When the priors are exchangeable the mixture posterior _aliases_ across each of
these pyramids in parameter space: if we were given the mixture posterior
restricted to one of these pyramids then we could reconstruct the entire mixture
distribution by simply rotating that restricted distribution into each of the
other $K! - 1$ pyramids.  As we do this we also map the mode in the restricted
distribution into each pyramid, creating exactly the expected $K!$
multimodality.  Moreover, those rotations are exactly given by permuting
the parameter indices and reordering the corresponding parameter values.  

### Exchangeable Inferences and Ordering Constraints

From a Bayesian perspective, all well-defined inferences are given by
expectations of certain functions with respect to our posterior distribution.  
Hence if we want to limit ourselves to only those inferences insensitive
to the labeling then we have to considering expectations only of those functions
that are permutation invariant,
$f(\sigma(\boldsymbol{\alpha})) = f(\boldsymbol{\alpha})$.

Importantly, under this class of functions the symmetry of the degenerate
mixture posterior carries over to the expectation values themselves: the
expectation taken over each pyramid will yield exactly the same value.  
Consequently we should be able to avoid the combinatorial cost of fitting the
full mixture model by simply restricting our exploration to a single ordering
of the parameters.

Imposing an ordering on parameter space can be taken as a a computational trick,
but it can also be interpreted as method of making an exchangeable prior
non-exchangeable without affecting the resulting inferences.  Given the
exchangeable prior $\pi (\boldsymbol{\alpha})$ we define the
non-exchangeable prior
$$
\pi' (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) =
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\pi (\boldsymbol{\alpha}), & \alpha_1 \le  \ldots \le \alpha_K \\
0, & \mathrm{else}
\end{array}
\right. ,
$$
which limits the mixture posterior, and hence any expectations, to a single
ordering.  From this perspective _all_ of our strategies for breaking the
labeling degeneracy reduce to imposing a non-exchangeable prior.

In this section I will formalize the utility of ordering by proving that the
resulting inferences are indeed correct.  In order to outline the proof we
will first consider a two-component mixture before moving onto the general
case.

#### Two-Component Case

In the two-component case we have two parameters, $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$,
and two mixture weights, $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2 = 1 - \theta_1$.

We begin with the desired expectation and decompose it over the two pyramids
that arise in the two-dimensional parameter space,
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ f ]
&=
\int \mathrm{d} \theta_1 \mathrm{d} \theta_2
     \mathrm{d} \alpha_1 \mathrm{d} \alpha_2 \cdot
f (\alpha_1, \alpha_2) \cdot
\pi (\alpha_1 ,\alpha_2, \theta_1 ,\theta_2 \mid y)
\\
&\propto
\int \mathrm{d} \theta_1 \mathrm{d} \theta_2
     \mathrm{d} \alpha_1 \mathrm{d} \alpha_2 \cdot
f (\alpha_1, \alpha_2) \cdot
\pi (\alpha_1 ,\alpha_2) \,
\pi (\theta_1 ,\theta_2) \,
( \theta_1 \pi (y \mid \alpha_1) + \theta_2 \pi (y \mid \alpha_2) )
\\
&\propto \quad
\int_{\alpha_1 < \alpha_2} \mathrm{d} \theta_1 \mathrm{d} \theta_2
     \mathrm{d} \alpha_1 \mathrm{d} \alpha_2 \cdot
f (\alpha_1, \alpha_2) \cdot
\pi (\alpha_1 ,\alpha_2) \,
\pi (\theta_1 ,\theta_2) \,
( \theta_1 \pi (y \mid \alpha_1) + \theta_2 \pi (y \mid \alpha_2) )
\\
&\quad +
\int_{\alpha_2 < \alpha_1} \mathrm{d} \theta_1 \mathrm{d} \theta_2
     \mathrm{d} \alpha_1 \mathrm{d} \alpha_2 \cdot
f (\alpha_1, \alpha_2) \cdot
\pi (\alpha_1 ,\alpha_2) \,
\pi (\theta_1 ,\theta_2) \,
( \theta_1 \pi (y \mid \alpha_1) + \theta_2 \pi (y \mid \alpha_2) ).
\end{align*}
$$

We want to manipulate the second term into something that looks like the
first, which we can accomplish with a permutation of the parameters,
$(\alpha_1, \alpha_2) \rightarrow (\beta_2, \beta_1)$ and
$(\theta_1, \theta_2) \rightarrow (\lambda_2, \lambda_1)$, that rotates the
second pyramid into the first.  This gives
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ f ]
&\propto \quad
\int_{\alpha_1 < \alpha_2} \mathrm{d} \theta_1 \mathrm{d} \theta_2
    \mathrm{d} \alpha_1 \mathrm{d} \alpha_2 \cdot
f (\alpha_1, \alpha_2) \cdot
\pi (\alpha_1 ,\alpha_2) \,
\pi (\theta_1 ,\theta_2) \,
( \theta_1 \pi (y \mid \alpha_1) + \theta_2 \pi (y \mid \alpha_2) )
\\
&\quad +
\int_{\beta_1 < \beta_2} \mathrm{d} \lambda_2 \mathrm{d} \lambda_1
    \mathrm{d} \beta_2 \mathrm{d} \beta_1 \cdot
f (\beta_2, \beta_1) \cdot
\pi (\beta_2, \beta_1) \,
\pi (\lambda_2 ,\lambda_1) \,
( \lambda_2 \pi (y \mid \beta_2) + \lambda_1 \pi (y \mid \beta_1) )
\\
&\propto \quad
\int_{\alpha_1 < \alpha_2} \mathrm{d} \theta_1 \mathrm{d} \theta_2
    \mathrm{d} \alpha_1 \mathrm{d} \alpha_2 \cdot
f (\alpha_1, \alpha_2) \cdot
\pi (\alpha_1 ,\alpha_2) \,
\pi (\theta_1 ,\theta_2) \,
( \theta_1 \pi (y \mid \alpha_1) + \theta_2 \pi (y \mid \alpha_2) )
\\
&\quad +
\int_{\beta_1 < \beta_2} \mathrm{d} \lambda_1 \mathrm{d} \lambda_2
    \mathrm{d} \beta_1 \mathrm{d} \beta_2 \cdot
f (\beta_2, \beta_1) \cdot
\pi (\beta_2, \beta_1) \,
\pi (\lambda_2 ,\lambda_1) \,
(  \lambda_1 \pi (y \mid \beta_1) + \lambda_2 \pi (y \mid \beta_2) ).
\end{align*}
$$

Now we exploit the permutation-invariance of $f$ and the exchangeability of
the priors to massage the second term to be equivalent to the first,
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ f ]
&\propto \quad
\int_{\alpha_1 < \alpha_2} \mathrm{d} \theta_1 \mathrm{d} \theta_2
    \mathrm{d} \alpha_1 \mathrm{d} \alpha_2 \cdot
f (\alpha_1, \alpha_2) \cdot
\pi (\alpha_1 ,\alpha_2) \,
\pi (\theta_1 ,\theta_2) \,
( \theta_1 \pi (y \mid \alpha_1) + \theta_2 \pi (y \mid \alpha_2) )
\\
&\quad +
\int_{\beta_1 < \beta_2} \mathrm{d} \lambda_1 \mathrm{d} \lambda_2
    \mathrm{d} \beta_1 \mathrm{d} \beta_2 \cdot
f (\beta_1, \beta_2) \cdot
\pi (\beta_1, \beta_2) \,
\pi (\lambda_1 ,\lambda_2) \,
(  \lambda_1 \pi (y \mid \beta_1) + \lambda_2 \pi (y \mid \beta_2) )
\\
&\propto
2 \int_{\alpha_1 < \alpha_2} \mathrm{d} \theta_1 \mathrm{d} \theta_2
    \mathrm{d} \alpha_1 \mathrm{d} \alpha_2 \cdot
f (\alpha_1, \alpha_2) \cdot
\pi (\alpha_1 ,\alpha_2) \,
\pi (\theta_1 ,\theta_2) \,
( \theta_1 \pi (y \mid \alpha_1) + \theta_2 \pi (y \mid \alpha_2) )
\\
&\propto
\int_{\alpha_1 < \alpha_2} \mathrm{d} \theta_1 \mathrm{d} \theta_2
    \mathrm{d} \alpha_1 \mathrm{d} \alpha_2 \cdot
f (\alpha_1, \alpha_2) \cdot
2 \pi (\alpha_1 ,\alpha_2) \,
\pi (\theta_1 ,\theta_2) \,
2 ( \theta_1 \pi (y \mid \alpha_1) + \theta_2 \pi (y \mid \alpha_2) )
\\
&=
\int_{\alpha_1 < \alpha_2} \mathrm{d} \theta_1 \mathrm{d} \theta_2
    \mathrm{d} \alpha_1 \mathrm{d} \alpha_2 \cdot
f (\alpha_1, \alpha_2) \cdot
\pi' (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \theta_1, \theta_2 \mid y).
\end{align*}
$$

$\pi' (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \theta_1, \theta_2)$, however, is exactly the mixture
posterior density restricted to the pyramid defined by the standard ordering, so
we finally have
$$
\mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ f ] = \mathbb{E}_{\pi'} [ f ].
$$
In words, taking an expectation over the pyramid defined by the standard
ordering yields the same value as the expectation taken over the entire
parameter space.  Only the distribution over that one pyramid is no longer
multimodal!

#### General Case

The general case follows almost exactly once we use permutations of the standard
ordering to identify each pyramid of the $K!$ pyramids.  Writing $\Sigma'$ as
the set of all $K! - 1$ label permutations except for the trivial permutation,
the desired expectation decomposes as
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ f ]
&=
\int \prod_{k = 1}^{K} \mathrm{d} \theta_k \mathrm{d} \alpha_k \cdot
f (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \cdot
\pi (\boldsymbol{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{\theta} \mid y)
\\
&\propto
\int \prod_{k = 1}^{K} \mathrm{d} \theta_k \mathrm{d} \alpha_k \cdot
f (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \cdot
\pi (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \, \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \,
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \theta_k \, \pi (y \mid \alpha_k)
\\
&\propto \quad
\int_{\alpha_1 < \ldots < \alpha_K}
\prod_{k = 1}^{K} \mathrm{d} \theta_k \mathrm{d} \alpha_k \cdot
f (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \cdot
\pi (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \, \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \,
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \theta_k \, \pi (y \mid \alpha_k)
\\
&\quad + \sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma'}
\int_{\alpha_{\sigma(1)} < \ldots < \alpha_{\sigma(K)}}
\prod_{k = 1}^{K} \mathrm{d} \theta_k \mathrm{d} \alpha_k \cdot
f (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \cdot
\pi (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \, \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \,
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \theta_k \, \pi (y \mid \alpha_k).
\end{align*}
$$

In the permuted terms we apply the transformations
$$
\sigma( \boldsymbol{\alpha} )
\mapsto \boldsymbol{\beta}, \,
\sigma( \boldsymbol{\theta} )
\mapsto \boldsymbol{\lambda}
$$
to give
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ f ]
&\propto \quad
\int_{\alpha_1 < \ldots < \alpha_K}
\prod_{k = 1}^{K} \mathrm{d} \theta_k \mathrm{d} \alpha_k \cdot
f (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \cdot
\pi (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \, \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \,
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \theta_k \, \pi (y \mid \alpha_k)
\\
&\quad + \sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma'}
\int_{\beta_1 < \ldots < \beta_K}
\prod_{k = 1}^{K}
\mathrm{d} \lambda_{\sigma^{-1}(k)} \mathrm{d} \beta_{\sigma^{-1}(k)} \cdot
f ( \sigma^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\beta}) ) \cdot
\pi ( \sigma^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\beta}) ) \,
\pi ( \sigma^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\lambda}) ) \,
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \lambda_{\sigma^{-1}(k)} \, \pi (y \mid \beta_{\sigma^{-1}(k)})
\\
&\propto \quad
\int_{\alpha_1 < \ldots < \alpha_K}
\prod_{k = 1}^{K} \mathrm{d} \theta_k \mathrm{d} \alpha_k \cdot
f (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \cdot
\pi (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \, \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \,
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \theta_k \, \pi (y \mid \alpha_k)
\\
&\quad + \sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma'}
\int_{\beta_1 < \ldots < \beta_K}
\prod_{k' = 1}^{K}
\mathrm{d} \lambda_{k'} \mathrm{d} \beta_{k'} \cdot
f ( \sigma^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\beta}) ) \cdot
\pi ( \sigma^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\beta}) ) \,
\pi ( \sigma^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\lambda}) ) \,
\sum_{k' = 1}^{K} \lambda_{k'} \, \pi (y \mid \beta_{k'}).
\end{align*}
$$
We now exploit the permutation-invariance of $f$ and the exchangeability
of the priors to give
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}_{\pi} [ f ]
&\propto \quad
\int_{\alpha_1 < \ldots < \alpha_K}
\prod_{k = 1}^{K} \mathrm{d} \theta_k \mathrm{d} \alpha_k \cdot
f (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \cdot
\pi (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \, \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \,
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \theta_k \, \pi (y \mid \alpha_k)
\\
&\quad + \sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma'}
\int_{\beta_1 < \ldots < \beta_K}
\prod_{k' = 1}^{K}
\mathrm{d} \lambda_{k'} \mathrm{d} \beta_{k'} \cdot
f ( \boldsymbol{\beta} ) \cdot
\pi ( \boldsymbol{\beta} ) \, \pi ( \boldsymbol{\lambda} ) \,
\sum_{k' = 1}^{K} \lambda_{k'} \, \pi (y \mid \beta_{k'})
\\
&\propto K!
\int_{\alpha_1 < \ldots < \alpha_K}
\prod_{k = 1}^{K} \mathrm{d} \theta_k \mathrm{d} \alpha_k \cdot
f (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \cdot
\pi (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \, \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \,
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \theta_k \, \pi (y \mid \alpha_k)
\\
&\propto
\int_{\alpha_1 < \ldots < \alpha_K}
\prod_{k = 1}^{K} \mathrm{d} \theta_k \mathrm{d} \alpha_k \cdot
f (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \cdot
K! \, \pi (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \, \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \,
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \theta_k \, \pi (y \mid \alpha_k)
\\
&= \int_{\alpha_1 < \ldots < \alpha_N}
\prod_{n = 1}^{K} \mathrm{d} \theta_n \mathrm{d} \alpha_n \cdot
f (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \cdot
\pi' (\boldsymbol{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{\theta} \mid y).
\end{align*}
$$

Once again
$$
\pi' (\boldsymbol{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{\theta} \mid y)
\propto
K! \, \pi (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \, \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \,
\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \theta_k \, \pi (y \mid \alpha_k)
$$
is exactly the mixture posterior density confined to the pyramid given by the
standard ordering.  Consequently, in general we can exactly recover the desired
expectation by integrating over only the region of parameter space satisfying
the chosen ordering constraint.

While the ordering is limited to scalar parameters, it can still prove useful
when the component distributions are multivariate.  Although we cannot order the
multivariate parameters themselves, ordering any one of the parameters is
sufficient to break the labeling degeneracy for the entire mixture.  

# A Bayesian Mixture Model Example

To illustrate the pathologies of Bayesian mixture models, and their potential
resolutions, let's consider a relatively simple example where the likelihood
is given by a mixture of two Gaussians,
$$
\pi(y_1, \ldots, y_N \mid \mu_1, \sigma_1, \mu_2, \sigma_2, \theta_1, \theta_2)
=
\sum_{n = 1}^{N}
\theta_1 \mathcal{N} (y_n \mid \mu_1, \sigma_1)
+ \theta_2 \mathcal{N} (y_n \mid \mu_2, \sigma_2).
$$
Note that the mixture is applied to each datum individually -- our model assumes
that each measurement is drawn from one of the components independently as
opposed to the entire dataset being drawn from one of the components as a whole.

We first define the component data generating processes to be well-separated
relative to their standard deviations,
```{r}
mu <- c(-2.75, 2.75);
sigma <- c(1, 1);
lambda <- 0.4
```

Then we simulate some data from the mixture likelihood by following its
generative structure, first drawing assignments for each measurement and then
drawing the measurements themselves from the corresponding Gaussian,
```{r}
set.seed(689934)

N <- 1000
z <- rbinom(N, 1, lambda) + 1;
y <- rnorm(N, mu[z], sigma[z]);
```
```{r, comment=NA}
library(rstan)
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)

stan_rdump(c("N", "y"), file="mix.data.R")
```

Let's now consider a Bayesian fit of this model, first with labeling
degeneracies and then with various attempted resolutions.

## A Degenerate Implementation

As discussed above, in order to ensure that the labeling degeneracies persist
in the posterior distribution we need exchangeable priors.  We can, for example,
accomplish this by assigning the identical priors to the Gaussian parameters,
$$
\mu_1, \mu_2 \sim \mathcal{N} (0, 2), \,
\sigma_1, \sigma_2 \sim \text{Half-}\mathcal{N} (0, 2),
$$
and a symmetric Beta distribution to the mixture weight,
$$
\theta_1 \sim \text{Beta} (5, 5).
$$
```{r, comment=NA}
writeLines(readLines("gauss_mix.stan"))
```

Equivalently we could also have defined $\theta$ as a two-dimensional simplex
with a $\text{Dirichlet}(5, 5)$ prior which would yield the same exact model.

Aware of the labeling degeneracy, let's go ahead and fit this Bayesian mixture
model in Stan,
```{r, cache=TRUE, comment=NA}
input_data <- read_rdump("mix.data.R")

degenerate_fit <- stan(file='gauss_mix.stan', data=input_data,
                       chains=4, seed=483892929, refresh=2000)
```

The split Rhat is atrocious, indicating that the chains are not exploring the
same regions of parameter space.
```{r, comment=NA}
print(degenerate_fit)
```
Indeed this is to be expected as the individual chains find and then explore
one of the two degenerate modes independently of the others,
```{r}
c_light_trans <- c("#DCBCBCBF")
c_light_highlight_trans <- c("#C79999BF")
c_mid_trans <- c("#B97C7CBF")
c_mid_highlight_trans <- c("#A25050BF")
c_dark_trans <- c("#8F2727BF")
c_dark_highlight_trans <- c("#7C0000BF")
```
```{r}
params1 <- as.data.frame(extract(degenerate_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,1,])
params2 <- as.data.frame(extract(degenerate_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,2,])
params3 <- as.data.frame(extract(degenerate_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,3,])
params4 <- as.data.frame(extract(degenerate_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,4,])

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(params1$"mu[1]", params1$"mu[2]", col=c_dark_highlight_trans, pch=16, cex=0.8,
     xlab="mu1", xlim=c(-3, 3), ylab="mu2", ylim=c(-3, 3))
points(params2$"mu[1]", params2$"mu[2]", col=c_dark_trans, pch=16, cex=0.8)
points(params3$"mu[1]", params3$"mu[2]", col=c_mid_highlight_trans, pch=16, cex=0.8)
points(params4$"mu[1]", params4$"mu[2]", col=c_mid_trans, pch=16, cex=0.8)
lines(0.08*(1:100) - 4, 0.08*(1:100) - 4, col="grey", lw=2)
legend("topright", c("Chain 1", "Chain 2", "Chain 3", "Chain 4"),
       fill=c(c_dark_highlight_trans, c_dark_trans,
              c_mid_highlight_trans, c_mid_trans), box.lty=0, inset=0.0005)
```

This degenerate example is a particularly nice demonstration of the importance
of running multiple chains in any MCMC analysis.  If we had run just one chain
then we would have had no indication of the multimodality in our the posterior
and the incompleteness of our fits!

## Breaking the Labeling Degeneracy with Non-exchangeable Priors

Our first potential resolution of the labeling degeneracy is to tweak the
priors to no longer be exchangeable.  With no reason to expect that
the standard deviations will vary between the two components, we will instead
adjust the priors for the means to strongly favor $\mu_1$ positive and $\mu_2$
negative,
```{r, comment=NA}
writeLines(readLines("gauss_mix_asym_prior.stan"))
```

Running in Stan
```{r, cache=TRUE, comment=NA}
asym_fit <- stan(file='gauss_mix_asym_prior.stan', data=input_data,
                 chains=4, seed=483892929, refresh=2000)
```
we see that split Rhat still looks terrible,
```{r, comment=NA}
print(asym_fit)
```

Investigating the fit output we see that despite our strong, asymmetric prior
the posterior distribution is still multimodal and the disfavored mode is still
capturing chains,
```{r}
params1 <- as.data.frame(extract(asym_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,1,])
params2 <- as.data.frame(extract(asym_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,2,])
params3 <- as.data.frame(extract(asym_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,3,])
params4 <- as.data.frame(extract(asym_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,4,])

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(params1$"mu[1]", params1$"mu[2]", col=c_dark_highlight_trans, pch=16, cex=0.8,
     xlab="mu1", xlim=c(-3, 3), ylab="mu2", ylim=c(-3, 3))
points(params2$"mu[1]", params2$"mu[2]", col=c_dark_trans, pch=16, cex=0.8)
points(params3$"mu[1]", params3$"mu[2]", col=c_mid_highlight_trans, pch=16, cex=0.8)
points(params4$"mu[1]", params4$"mu[2]", col=c_mid_trans, pch=16, cex=0.8)
lines(0.08*(1:100) - 4, 0.08*(1:100) - 4, col="grey", lw=2)
legend("topright", c("Chain 1", "Chain 2", "Chain 3", "Chain 4"),
       fill=c(c_dark_highlight_trans, c_dark_trans,
              c_mid_highlight_trans, c_mid_trans), box.lty=0, inset=0.0005)
```

This example clearly demonstrates the subtle challenge of trying to resolve
labeling degeneracy with most non-exchangeable prior distributions.  When there
are many data the mixture likelihood will be very informative and it can easily
overwhelm even strong prior information.  The posterior will no longer be symmetric
between the degenerate modes, but the disfavored modes will still have
sufficiently significant posterior mass to require exploration in the fit.

Reducing the amount data, however, reduces the influence of the likelihood and
makes it easier to corral the mixture components in principled directions.  With
a smaller data set,
```{r, cache=TRUE, comment=NA}
N <- 100
z <- rbinom(N, 1, lambda) + 1;
y <- rnorm(N, mu[z], sigma[z]);

stan_rdump(c("N", "y"), file="mix_low.data.R")
input_low_data <- read_rdump("mix_low.data.R")

asym_fit <- stan(file='gauss_mix_asym_prior.stan', data=input_low_data,
                 chains=4, seed=483892929, refresh=2000)
```
we achieve a much better fit,
```{r, comment=NA}
print(asym_fit)
```
All of our chains converge to the favored mode and our inference become
well-behaved,
```{r}
params1 <- as.data.frame(extract(asym_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,1,])
params2 <- as.data.frame(extract(asym_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,2,])
params3 <- as.data.frame(extract(asym_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,3,])
params4 <- as.data.frame(extract(asym_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,4,])

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(params1$"mu[1]", params1$"mu[2]", col=c_dark_highlight_trans, pch=16, cex=0.8,
     xlab="mu1", xlim=c(-3, 3), ylab="mu2", ylim=c(-3, 3))
points(params2$"mu[1]", params2$"mu[2]", col=c_dark_trans, pch=16, cex=0.8)
points(params3$"mu[1]", params3$"mu[2]", col=c_mid_highlight_trans, pch=16, cex=0.8)
points(params4$"mu[1]", params4$"mu[2]", col=c_mid_trans, pch=16, cex=0.8)
lines(0.08*(1:100) - 4, 0.08*(1:100) - 4, col="grey", lw=2)
legend("topright", c("Chain 1", "Chain 2", "Chain 3", "Chain 4"),
       fill=c(c_dark_highlight_trans, c_dark_trans,
              c_mid_highlight_trans, c_mid_trans), box.lty=0, inset=0.0005)
```

Still, extreme care must be taken when using this approach to ensure that the
priors are strong enough to suppress the labeling degeneracy.  In particular,
running multiple chains is critical to identifying insufficiently strong priors.

## Breaking the Labeling Degeneracy by Enforcing an Ordering

If we consider only inferences insensitive to the labelings then we can also
keep the exchangeable priors but impose an ordering on one of the component
parameters.  Alternatively, we can consider this as making the exchangeable
prior non-exchangeable by restricting it to a subset of parameter space.
Following a similar logic that motivated tweaking the component means above,
we'll order the means here.  Fortunately, imposing such an order in Stan could
not be easier -- as we have to do is employ the ```ordered``` type,
```{r, comment=NA}
writeLines(readLines("gauss_mix_ordered_prior.stan"))
```

Running the model in Stan
```{r, cache=TRUE, comment=NA}
ordered_fit <- stan(file='gauss_mix_ordered_prior.stan', data=input_data,
                    chains=4, seed=483892929, refresh=2000)
```
we immediately recover a better fit,
```{r, comment=NA}
print(ordered_fit)
```
with all of the chains exploring the mode satisfying the standard ordering
$$\mu_1 \le \mu_2,$$
```{r}
params1 <- as.data.frame(extract(ordered_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,1,])
params2 <- as.data.frame(extract(ordered_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,2,])
params3 <- as.data.frame(extract(ordered_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,3,])
params4 <- as.data.frame(extract(ordered_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,4,])

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(params1$"mu[1]", params1$"mu[2]", col=c_dark_highlight_trans, pch=16, cex=0.8,
     xlab="mu1", xlim=c(-3, 3), ylab="mu2", ylim=c(-3, 3))
points(params2$"mu[1]", params2$"mu[2]", col=c_dark_trans, pch=16, cex=0.8)
points(params3$"mu[1]", params3$"mu[2]", col=c_mid_highlight_trans, pch=16, cex=0.8)
points(params4$"mu[1]", params4$"mu[2]", col=c_mid_trans, pch=16, cex=0.8)
lines(0.08*(1:100) - 4, 0.08*(1:100) - 4, col="grey", lw=2)
legend("topright", c("Chain 1", "Chain 2", "Chain 3", "Chain 4"),
       fill=c(c_dark_highlight_trans, c_dark_trans,
              c_mid_highlight_trans, c_mid_trans), box.lty=0, inset=0.0005)
```

Contrast the immediate success achieved by ordering with the subtleties required
to get a directly non-exchangeable prior to yield a good fit.

# Singular Components and Computational Issues

Unfortunately, there is one more pathology hidden in mixture models that can
seriously compromise the accuracy of a fit.  If two of the mixture components
overlap then the resulting posterior manifests a particularly nasty geometry
that is difficult to explore.  This overlap is especially common when there
are more components in the mixture than needed to capture the structure in the
data, and excess components are forced to collapse into the necessary
components.  

To see this let's simulate a measurement where the two mixture components are
located less than one standard deviation away from each other,
```{r}
N <- 1000
mu <- c(-0.75, 0.75);
sigma <- c(1, 1);
lambda <- 0.4
z <- rbinom(N, 1, lambda) + 1;
y <- rnorm(N, mu[z], sigma[z]);

stan_rdump(c("N", "y"), file="collapse_mix.data.R")
```

Before fitting the joint model over the component parameters and the mixture
weights, let's try to fit conditioned on a single mixture weight.  Note that we
will be using just a single chain in this section as the posteriors will all be
unimodal, but in practice one should always multiple chains as we will not have
such a guarantee.
```{r, comment=NA}
writeLines(readLines("gauss_mix_given_theta.stan"))
```

```{r, cache=TRUE, comment=NA}
theta <- 0.25
stan_rdump(c("N", "y", "theta"), file="collapse_mix.data.R")

input_data <- read_rdump("collapse_mix.data.R")

singular_fit <- stan(file='gauss_mix_given_theta.stan', data=input_data,
                     chains=1, iter=11000, warmup=1000, seed=483892929,
                     refresh=11000)
```
Because the components are so close together they can move around to yield
similar fits to the data, and the multimodal non-identifiability from the
labeling degeneracy collapses into a strong continuous non-identifiability,
```{r}
c_light <- c("#DCBCBC")
c_light_highlight <- c("#C79999")
c_mid <- c("#B97C7C")
c_mid_highlight <- c("#A25050")
c_dark <- c("#8F2727")
c_dark_highlight <- c("#7C0000")
```
```{r}
params25 <- as.data.frame(extract(singular_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,1,])

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(params25$"mu[1]", params25$"mu[2]", col=c_dark_highlight, pch=16, cex=0.8,
     xlab="mu1", xlim=c(-3, 3), ylab="mu2", ylim=c(-3, 3))
lines(0.08*(1:100) - 4, 0.08*(1:100) - 4, col="grey", lw=2)
```

Interestingly, as we change the mixture weight the non-identifiability rotates
around parameter space,
```{r, cache=TRUE, comment=NA}
theta <- 0.5
stan_rdump(c("N", "y", "theta"), file="collapse_mix.data.R")

input_data <- read_rdump("collapse_mix.data.R")

singular_fit <- stan(file='gauss_mix_given_theta.stan', data=input_data,
                     chains=1, iter=11000, warmup=1000, seed=483892929,
                     refresh=11000)

params50 <- as.data.frame(extract(singular_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,1,])
```

```{r, cache=TRUE, comment=NA}
theta <- 0.75
stan_rdump(c("N", "y", "theta"), file="collapse_mix.data.R")

input_data <- read_rdump("collapse_mix.data.R")

singular_fit <- stan(file='gauss_mix_given_theta.stan', data=input_data,
                     chains=1, iter=11000, warmup=1000, seed=483892929,
                     refresh=11000)

params75 <- as.data.frame(extract(singular_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,1,])
```

```{r}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(params25$"mu[1]", params25$"mu[2]", col=c_dark_highlight, pch=16, cex=0.8,
     xlab="mu1", xlim=c(-3, 3), ylab="mu2", ylim=c(-3, 3))
points(params50$"mu[1]", params50$"mu[2]", col=c_mid_highlight, pch=16, cex=0.8)
points(params75$"mu[1]", params75$"mu[2]", col=c_light_highlight, pch=16, cex=0.8)

lines(0.08*(1:100) - 4, 0.08*(1:100) - 4, col="grey", lw=2)

legend("topleft", c("Theta = 0.25", "Theta = 0.5", "Theta = 0.75"),
       fill=c(c_dark_highlight, c_mid_highlight, c_light_highlight), bty="n")
```

These conditional posteriors are not ideal, but they can be adequately fit with
the state-of-the-art Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler in Stan.  Unfortunately,
when we try to fit the mixture weight jointly with the component parameters the
conditional pathologies aggregate into something worse.
```{r, cache=TRUE, comment=NA}
singular_fit <- stan(file='gauss_mix.stan', data=input_data,
                     chains=1, iter=11000, warmup=1000, seed=483892929,
                     refresh=11000)
```

The problem is that the collapsing components do not inform the mixture weights
particularly well, and the posterior is changed little from the prior,
```{r}
params1 <- as.data.frame(extract(singular_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,1,])

breaks=(0:50) / 50
prior_hist <- hist(rbeta(10000, 5, 5), breaks=breaks, plot=FALSE)
post_hist <- hist(params1$theta, breaks=breaks, plot=FALSE)

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(prior_hist, col=c_light_trans, border=c_light_highlight_trans,
     main="", xlab="theta", yaxt='n', ann=FALSE)
plot(post_hist, col=c_dark_trans, border=c_dark_highlight_trans, add=T)
legend("topright", c("Posterior", "Prior"),
       fill=c(c_dark_trans, c_light_trans), bty="n")
```

Consequently the joint posterior simply aggregates the conditional posteriors
together, resulting in a "bowtie" geometry,
```{r}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(params1$"mu[1]", params1$"mu[2]", col=c_dark_highlight, pch=16, cex=0.8,
     xlab="mu1", xlim=c(-3, 3), ylab="mu2", ylim=c(-3, 3))
lines(0.08*(1:100) - 4, 0.08*(1:100) - 4, col="grey", lw=2)
```

The sharp corners of the bowtie slow exploration, resulting in relatively few
effective samples per iteration for the component means,
```{r, comment=NA}
print(singular_fit)
```
While the bowtie geometry slows exploration for this particular model, however,
it does not bias it -- there are no divergences or other failing diagnostics,
```{r, comment=NA}
sum(get_sampler_params(singular_fit, inc_warmup=FALSE)[[1]][,'divergent__'])
```
Consequently we can readily overcome the slower exploration by running longer
or, even better, running multiple chains.  Still, care must be taken in practice
to ensure that the posterior geometry does not become too pathological for Stan
to accurately fit.

Moreover, imposing a parameter ordering simply cuts the bowtie in half,
maintaining the potentially pathological geometry,
```{r, , cache=TRUE, comment=NA}
singular_fit <- stan(file='gauss_mix_ordered_prior.stan', data=input_data,
                     chains=1, iter=11000, warmup=1000, seed=483892929,
                     refresh=11000)

params1 <- as.data.frame(extract(singular_fit, permuted=FALSE)[,1,])

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(params1$"mu[1]", params1$"mu[2]", col=c_dark_highlight, pch=16, cex=0.8,
     xlab="mu1", xlim=c(-3, 3), ylab="mu2", ylim=c(-3, 3))
lines(0.08*(1:100) - 4, 0.08*(1:100) - 4, col="grey", lw=2)
```

In order to avoid the bowtie geometry entirely we would need to ensure that the
components are sufficiently separated.  If this separation is not induced
by the likelihood then it could be enforced with a prescient choice of prior,
in particular one that "repels" the components from each other without
sacrificing exchangeability.  The development of such repulsive priors
is an active topic of research.

# Discussion

The labeling non-identifiability inherent to degenerate mixture models yields
multimodal distributions that even the most start-of-the-art computational
algorithms cannot fit.  In order to ensure accurate fits we need to break the
labeling degeneracy in some way.

From the perspective of Bayesian mixture models we can break this degeneracy
by complementing the mixture likelihood with non-exchangeable prior information.
A principled prior that assigns each mixture component to a specific
responsibility will break the degeneracy, but unless that prior is incredibly
strong the modes corresponding to disfavored assignments will maintain enough
posterior mass to require exploration.  Alternatively, a non-exchangeable prior
that enforces a standard parameter ordering exactly removes the labeling
degeneracy without compromising inferences.

Even with the labeling degeneracy removed, however, Bayesian mixture models can
still be troublesome to fit.  As components begin to collapse into each other,
for example, the posterior geometry becomes more and more pathological.
Furthermore, mixture models often exhibit multimodalities beyond just those
induced by the labeling degeneracy.  Resolving the degeneracy does not eliminate
these tangible modes and the computational issues they beget.  

As with so many modeling techniques, mixture models can be powerful in practice
provided that they are employed with great care.
